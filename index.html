    <h2>Dear Baby Caramel,</h2>
    <p>
      I am writing this letter to celebrate our 2nd Valentine’s day together...  
      (I am writing this letter to celebrate our 2nd Valentine’s day together and to show how far we’ve come.  
      I am eternally grateful to call you mine. You are the sweetest, most caring, kindest, smartest,  
      prettiest, most loving, and awesome person I’ve ever met.  
      Even if I had infinite words, it wouldn’t adequately capture your soul—  
      a 1-of-1 star in the night sky, the brightest one that shines eternally.  
      <br><br>
      From the moment I spoke to you, my soul has been drawn towards you.  
      You make my heart flutter, you calm me in tough times,  
      you make me happy in sad times, and you make me into the best version of myself.  
      <br><br>
      We've laughed, we've cried, and we've grown so much since the start of our relationship.  
      We’ve learned from our mistakes, and through all of that, our love has shined through  
      like a diamond in the rough.  
      <br><br>
      Thank you for everything you’ve done for me.  
      I’m eternally thankful to call you mine ❤️. )  
    </p>
    <p class="closing">Forever yours,<br> [Mr.Fuit]</p>
